# Product Elements

Ultimately a product is an experience or solution provided to a customer. Products have many dimensions. Each category below represents an important and unique element to be considered in the test strategy. Software is complex and invisible — take care to cover all of it that matters, not just the parts that are easy to see.

## Structure — *Everything that comprises the physical product*

- **Code**: the code structures that comprise the product, from executables to individual routines.
- **Hardware**: any hardware component that is integral to the product.
- **Service**: any server or process running independently of others that may comprise the product.
- **Non-executable files**: any files other than multimedia or programs, like text files, sample data, or help files.
- **Collateral**: anything beyond that is also part of the product, such as paper documents, web pages, packaging, license agreements, etc.

## Function — *Everything that the product does*

- **Multi-user/Social**: any function designed to facilitate interaction among people or to allow concurrent access to the same resources.
- **Calculation**: any arithmetic function or arithmetic operations embedded in other functions.
- **Time-related**: time-out settings; periodic events; time zones; business holidays; terms and warranty periods; chronograph functions.
- **Security-related**: rights of each class of user; protection of data; encryption; front end vs. back end protections; vulnerabilities in sub-systems.
- **Transformations**: functions that modify or transform something (e.g. setting fonts, inserting clip art, withdrawing money from account).
- **Startup/Shutdown**: each method and interface for invocation and initialisation as well as exiting the product.
- **Multimedia**: sounds, bitmaps, videos, or any graphical display embedded in the product.
- **Error Handling**: any functions that detect and recover from errors, including all error messages.
- **Interactions**: any interactions between functions within the product.
- **Testability**: any functions provided to help test the product, such as diagnostics, log files, asserts, test menus, etc.

## Data — *Everything that the product processes and produces*

- **Input/Output**: any data that is processed by the product, and any data that results from that processing.
- **Preset**: any data that is supplied as part of the product, or otherwise built into it, such as prefabricated databases, default values, etc.
- **Persistent**: any data that is expected to persist over multiple operations. This includes modes or states of the product, such as options settings, view modes, contents of documents, etc.
- **Interdependent/Interacting**: any data that influences or is influenced by the state of other data; or jointly influences an output.
- **Sequences/Combinations**: any ordering or permutation of data, e.g. word order, sorted vs. unsorted data, order of tests.
- **Cardinality**: numbers of objects or fields may vary (e.g. zero, one, many, max, open limit). Some may have to be unique (e.g. database keys).
- **Big/Little**: variations in the size and aggregation of data.
- **Invalid/Noise**: any data or state that is invalid, corrupted, or produced in an uncontrolled or incorrect fashion.
- **Lifecycle**: transformations over the lifetime of a data entity as it is created, accessed, modified, and deleted.

---

## Interfaces — *Every conduit by which the product is accessed or expressed*

- **User Interfaces**: any element that mediates the exchange of data with the user (e.g. displays, buttons, fields, whether physical or virtual).
- **System Interfaces**: any interface with something other than a user, such as engineering logs, other programs, hard disk, network, etc.
- **API/SDK**: any programmatic interfaces or tools intended to allow the development of new applications using this product.
- **Import/Export**: any functions that package data for use by a different product, or interpret data from a different product.

---

## Platform — *Everything on which the product depends (and that is outside your project)*

- **External Hardware**: hardware components and configurations that are not part of the shipping product, but are required (or optional) for the product to work: systems, servers, memory, keyboards, the Cloud.
- **External Software**: software components and configurations that are not a part of the shipping product, but are required (or optional) for the product to work: operating systems, concurrently executing applications, drivers, fonts, etc.
- **Embedded Components**: libraries and other components that are embedded in your product but are produced outside your project.
- **Product Footprint**: the resources in the environment that are used, reserved, or consumed by the product (memory, filehandles, etc.).

---

## Operations — *How the product will be used*

- **Users**: the attributes of the various kinds of users.
- **Environment**: the physical environment in which the product operates, including such elements as noise, light, and distractions.
- **Common Use**: patterns and sequences of input that the product will typically encounter. This varies by user.
- **Disfavoured Use**: patterns of input produced by ignorant, mistaken, careless or malicious use.
- **Extreme Use**: challenging patterns and sequences of input that are consistent with the intended use of the product.

---

## Time — *Any relationship between the product and time*

- **Input/Output**: when input is provided, when output is created, and any timing relationships (delays, intervals, etc.) among them.
- **Fast/Slow**: testing with "fast" or "slow" input; fastest and slowest; combinations of fast and slow.
- **Changing Rates**: speeding up and slowing down (spikes, bursts, hangs, bottlenecks, interruptions).
- **Concurrency**: more than one thing happening at once (multi-user, time-sharing, threads, semaphores, shared data).
